# Cat-Clicker-Premium Pro #

I took my Cat-Clicker Project(Through Udacity) that I made previously, and re-wrote it with OOP(Object-Oriented Programing). Also I managed to incorporate MVO(Model/View/Octopus) into my JavaScript to keep the code organized.
* I just recently made the Cat Clicker Premium Pro version!
