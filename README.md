# Cat-Clicker-Premium #

I took my Cat-Clicker Project(Through Udacity) that I made previously, and re-wrote it with OOP(Object-Oriented Programing). Also I managed to incorporate MVO(Model/View/Octopus) into my JavaScript to keep the code organized.
* I removed the radio buttons(for the time being), and went with a list item.  I would like to incorporate the radio buttons into this version at some point.
