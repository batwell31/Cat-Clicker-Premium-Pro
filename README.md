# Cat-Clicker-Premium #

This was a little mini-project given to me by Udacity.  It's a fully responsive, and if you click the picture of my cat you will notice the "Total Clicks" will increase.  It was a fun project as it was based off of everything I've learned so far.  I really had fun making this!  Currently it's on the premium version of the cat-clicker!  There are 5 cats you can choose between and click on!

## API Resources ##

I'm using bootstrap to make the website responsive.  I find it easier, and faster to get a fully responsive website.

## The Imgs ##

* You will see a picture I took of my cat Danica, on my couch.
* As well as a picture of my old roomates cat Philip, asleep on my computer desk.

## Instructions ##

1) Select one of the cats (radio-button).
2) Press Submit.
3) Click the cat and watch the total click rise with each click!

* You can change cats by picking a different cat, and hitting submit again.  That will erase all your cat clicking progress, so be warned :)
